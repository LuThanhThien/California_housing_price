# California Housing Price
## PROJECT OUTLINE <br>
A very classical assignment for machine learning beginners: Building a model to predict California Housing Price. The target of this project is to find the relationship between housing value in California with other available features such as: median income, housing age, number of room in a house, etc, train a model that can predict housing price using Scikit Learn library. In this small end-to-end project, we will go through all stages of the real-time project as import, fetch data, prepare data, cleaning, choosing the right model, fine tuning the model, visualize the results and others. <br>

## SKILLS <br>
Through this project, we will develop many skills on supervised machine learning algorithm, using **Scikit Learn Library** to train and fine tune a model:
- Prepare data: use statistical knowledge to prepare data, know many methods to prepare train - test - validation set, visualize the raw data and find correlation.
- Clean data: deal with _Null_ values, categorial attributes by various methods (mean, median, most frequency, one-hot encoding, etc.), build fit-trans pipeline.
- Analyze data: select training models (**Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest**), evaluate, compare and fine tune models.
Besides those, we learn to use **Numpy** and **Pandas** library to handle with numerical values, **MatplotLib** to visualize the data.
## END-TO-END PROJECT
In this project, we will go through step by step like a real project which includes:
1. Prepare data: 
- Fetch data: fetch data from the Internet, create its workspace (folders contain the dataset).
- Split data to test and train (or even validation) set.
- Explore data by showing correlation and visualization.
2. Clean data: 
- Dealing with missing data or categorical attributes.
- Create a **pipeline** for data processing.
3. Train model:
- Select training models.
- Train models and compared their performance.
- Fine tune models.
4. Deploy model: making the trained model available for use in a production environment, where it can receive input data, make predictions, and provide outputs.

This project is derived from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow*, the comments are based on my level of understanding and there are also some adjustment in the code that I made myself to explore something new besides the book instruction. <br>
