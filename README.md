# California Housing Price
## PROJECT OUTLINE <br>
A very classical assignment for machine learning beginners: Building a model to predict California Housing Price. <br>
The target of this project is to find the relationship between housing value in California with other available features such as: median income, housing age, number of room in a house, etc. In this small end-to-end project, we will go through all stages of the real-time project as import, fetch data, prepare data, cleaning, choosing the right model, fine tuning the model, visualize the results and others. 
## SKILLS <br>
Through this project, we will develop many skills on supervised machine learning algorithm, using Scikit Learn Library to train and fine tune a model:
- Prepare data: use statistical knowledge to prepare data, know many methods to prepare train - test - validation set, visualize the raw data and find correlation.
- Clean data: deal with _Null_ values, categorial attributes by various methods (mean, median, most frequency, one-hot encoding, etc.), build fit-trans pipeline.
- Analyze data: select training models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), evaluate, compare and fine tune models.
Besides those, we learn to use Numpy and Pandas library to handle with numerical values, MatplotLib to visualize the data.
