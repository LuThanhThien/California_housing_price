# California Housing Price
## PROJECT OUTLINE <br>
A very classical assignment for machine learning beginners: Building a model to predict California Housing Price. <br>
The target of this project is to find the relationship between housing value in California with other available features such as: median income, housing age, number of room in a house, etc. In this small end-to-end project, we will go through all stages of the real-time project as import, fetch data, prepare data, cleaning, choosing the right model, fine tuning the model, visualize the results and others. 
## SKILLS <br>
Through this project, we will develop many skills on supervised machine learning algorithm, using Scikit Learn Library to train and fine tune a model:
- Prepare and clean data: use
